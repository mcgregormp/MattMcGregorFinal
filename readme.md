This map shows the number of trains that have crashed or had some type of failure while operating and the cost assosiated with that. The reason I chose this data set was to showcase the actually pretty common problem that trains have and how much money goes into fixing said trains. This map shows data ranging from 2005 to 2015. I chose the dark color theme because its a dark topic and so by chosing a dark Burgandy and Blue color I felt the theme for the map would be set. I chose to use the Chiller font because again its a dark theme and the Chiller font hurts my eyes just by looking at it. I had trouble linking the interactive section of the map up and it kept making my map blank so I had to try and troubleshoot my way around that problem. Everytime I did get the map to stay and become interactive it would strangly use the data from Lab 10 instead of the data I had downloaded. In the end I couldnt figure out how to get it to be interative but the darker the circle the more the failure cost the companies that owned the train. I am not sure if casualities are considered in this data set, hopefully their not because that would just make my map sad. The main locations where crashes and failures happen is in larger urban centers mainly on the east coast. The reason for this is because when rail was the main form of transportation the east coast was where pretty much all the large cities that could handle railroads were located.
